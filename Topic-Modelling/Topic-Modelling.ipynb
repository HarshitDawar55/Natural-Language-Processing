    "1. A random number of topics will be decided by the user to which the words from the document will be assigned.\n",
    "2. Each word from each document will be assigned to any of the random topics initially.\n",
    "3. Now, random topics from each document & words assignments to those topics in each document will be obtained. Although, initial assignment will not make any sense.\n",
    "4. Steps 2 & 3 will be repeated until the best assignments are provided using the formula given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each topic:  ***probability( topic \"t\" | document \"d\")*** <= Probability of topic \"t\" existing in document \"d\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For each word:  ***probability( word \"w\" | topic \"t\")*** <= Probability of word \"w\" belonging to topic \"t\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Final probability that a topic \"t\" generated word \"w\" in document \"d\": ***probability( topic \"t\" | document \"d\") * probability( word \"w\" | topic \"t\")***\n",

    "**Important Pointers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The user has to decide the number of topics to get from the document\n",
    "* The user has to interpret the topics itself.\n",

    "**Few Assumptions of LDA**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Documents are probability distributions over Topics, Topics are probabilty distributions over words.\n",
    "* Documents with similar topics uses similar groups of words.\n",
    "* Topics can be founded by searching for the words that occur across the corpus in documents. "
